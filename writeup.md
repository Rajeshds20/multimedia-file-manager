## Added Features : 

I have added options for searching files, filtering them with file type and Sorting based on Name and Types.
As we all know that the main purpose of File Manager application is to find and organize all the files in preferred format and Perform some operations like viewing, Renaming and deleting them. This obviously will be a handy place to find required files easily.

## Purpose of Adding Search, Filter, and Sort Features

### Searching
- **Purpose:** There wil be no file manager application without search feature. This is an essential feature that user expects from the application.
- Users can avoid manually scanning through a long list of files by directly searching for the desired file.

### Filtering
- **Purpose:** The filtering feature enables users to filter down the displayed files based on their types/formats. (e.g., audio, video, document, image).
- Simplified file management: Users can focus on specific types of files without distractions from other file types. Also allow users to go through each file types and all files of that type.

### Sorting
- **Purpose:** The sorting feature enables users to arrange the files in a desired order based on specific criteria (e.g., file name, file type).
- Customization: Users can organize the file list in a way that suits their preferences and working style.
- They can sort the Files in ascending order to work better with the files and find them in order.

#### PS : There is also a small feature added, i.e, highlighting the selected file in the list of files in the application to make user visible of their selected file. 

Overall, the addition of searching, filtering, and sorting features enhances the user's ability to efficiently navigate, locate, and manage files within the project. These are the features implemented to make the user get better use already present content and add more interactivity, ease. These features offer flexibility, customization, and improved usability, resulting in a more seamless and productive user experience.
